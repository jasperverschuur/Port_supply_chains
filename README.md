# Port supply chains

Code and data attached to the article Verschuur, Koks and Hall (2022), Portsâ€™ criticality in international trade and global supply-chains published in Nature Communications. 


-The 'Maritime_transport_model' folder contains the code and (part of the) input data to run the global maritime transport model. Some input data is too large to be uploaded to Github. Please get in touch if you would like to receive this data. The file 'Maritime_transport_model.py' includes the main code to load the data and run the model. The file 'transport_model_functions.py' contains the supporting functions. The file 'Post_process_output' takes the model output and further post-process it so it can be more easily analysed. 

-The 'Port_IO_tables' folder contains the code to link the transport model output to the EORA Input-Output tables (https://worldmrio.com/). The downloaded EORA26 file should be placed in the Input folder. This data is not there given the academic license used to download EORA26. 

The model output data that is used to create all figures in the article can be found on Mendeley data (doi: 10.17632/vzzy3b9gg4.1)
